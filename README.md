This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Node.js applications and its solution.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express server that throws an unhandled error within a `setTimeout` callback. This results in the server crashing without a graceful error response to the client.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using proper error handling techniques to catch and manage the exception.
